You're probably in a few right now.

But fear not, for I have crafted a solution to breathe life back into these forsaken realms!

Introducing **Minglebot**: a conversation starter to get people talking again.

‚öîÔ∏è [minglebot.neocities.org](https://minglebot.neocities.org) üõ°Ô∏è

Born from the ashes of dead servers, this **powerful artifact** is imbued with the arcane energies of the discord-interactions-js library.

So, why'd I build this?
‚Ü≥ I am on vacation and don't know what to do with myself  
‚Ü≥ I went to a JavaScript coding meetup in Montreal, and they seemed to think it was a good idea (shoutout to Stuart Spence and Jean-Philippe Martel)  
‚Ü≥ To flex my 90s web design muscles.

**Hot take:** Neocities is the unsung hero of landing pages.

Yes, the **Minglebot** landing page has a visitor counter.

It is best viewed in Netscape Navigator 4.0. Like everything is, duh.

I am not above adding cursor trails. Don't test me.

Help a sista out:

‚òë Submit the best question a stranger has ever asked you to my spreadsheet _ahem_ database here: [bit.ly/3WqipcF](https://bit.ly/3WqipcF)

‚òë Add the bot to your Discord, type in /mingle to get a conversation starter, and let me know how I can make it better.
